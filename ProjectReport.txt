AtoB.py takes accepts two parameters which are the GPS coordinates between the two points of which a .csv which connects the two points through a straight line must be made.
Takes the difference between the latitudes and longitudes of the the points and uses python client geopy to calculate the distance between the points.
Xdiff is difference in longitude and Ydiff is difference in latitude.

Examined the donkey_follow_car.csv to determine the distance between 2 .csv points which we obtained as 0.55m.
Designed the new .csv with the total Xdiff and Ydiff broken down into intermediate points, each with a difference of 0.55m.
This coordinates of these intermediate points is given in the .csv
